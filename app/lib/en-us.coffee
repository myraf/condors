      content: '''
        The California condor is a critically endangered species and the population is suffering from the effects of lead poisoning.
        By tracking the location and social behavior of the animals we can better detect early warning signs of the illness.

        We need you to look at some photos of condors taken by our motion-activated cameras.
        By identifying the tag number of each condor and their behavior around the feeding carcass,
        we can judge if the bird's eating or social problems can reveal lead poisoning.

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Condors are regularly released in several regions in California and are also frequently recaptured for medical care, including chelation for lead poisoning, which results from ingesting bullet fragments in carcasses from animals hunted with lead ammunition. Our project consists of hundreds of thousands of photographs taken by remotely triggered cameras at proffered feeding stations. These feeding stations are sites, located across the range of the condor in California, where uncontaminated animal carcasses are placed out for the birds to feed on,  in part to keep the birds acclimated so they can be trapped regularly for health monitoring. . Photos from these feeding stations are labor-intensive to process, and yet they provide some of the best data on the history of each bird’s behaviors and social interactions and also the best real-time information on the health of individual birds, since not all birds carry radio or GPS transmitters. Currently, managers glean only immediate health data from these photos, although the photographs contain many different kinds of information that could be used to better understand the social interactions, individual personalities of condors, and the ecology of this highly endangered species.</p>
      <h3>Data use and accessibility</h3>
      <p>Condors roost and forage in groups and group membership appears to be at least somewhat fluid on a daily basis, although mated pairs often forage together. Individuals foraging together may have a similar risk of being lead poisoned  if they jointly ingest contaminated carrion, especially if lead ammunition fragments are spread throughout carcasses. Alternatively, dominant individuals may exhibit the highest lead levels because they have first access to the bullet entry site, where the tough hide is pierced. For birds that have not reached full adult status, dominance is generally determined by age; among adults, dominance appears to be influenced by age as well as personality traits. If dominance increases lead ingestion, lead levels should increase with age up until adult status is attained. However, exploration and thus exposure to non-proffered food items may increase with age, which would also result in a pattern of increasing lead levels with age.</p>
      <p>Our project goal is to gain a better understanding of whether observed foraging associations and other patterns of feeding station use predicted blood lead levels in California condors.  We plan to assess the likelihood that associations at feeding stations predict foraging associations at wild locations, as well as evaluate the strength of social structuring and the temporal scale of associations in feeding aggregations. We will then test for whether age, sex, and rearing method predicted associations and the likelihood of feeding at feeding stations. Finally, we will evaluate whether age and associations between individuals predicted elevated blood lead levels.</p>
      <p>From the data collected by Condor Watch, we plan to generate a social network map of the condor population free-flying within California.  As the project gathers more data, social network maps will evolve. Detailed data on interactions between individuals in wild populations are rare. Therefore, we anticipate that these data will be of considerable interest to multiple groups of scientists--those interested in: patterns of social interactions; the effects of learning on reintroduction efforts; and ecotoxicological problems in wild species.  Data will be publically available through appendices in one or more scientific journal publications. We will also create a registry in the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB) database. KNB was created with input from National Center for Ecology and Statistics and is a go-to point for ecologists looking for appropriate datasets for testing novel analyses.</p>
      <h3>Preliminary findings on why this project is important</h3>
      <p>We completed a preliminary analysis of data collected at proffered feeding stations equipped with still and video cameras in Pinnacles National Park in California, USA. Condor associations were relatively fluid through time, with the probability of any two currently-associated individuals being associated in the future remaining constant for about a month then slowly declining towards rates expected from random or null association behavior. Association rates among pairs of condors at feeding stations did not predict the probability that both exhibited elevated lead levels. However, we plan to test this prediction with the larger data set generated through Condor Watch to determine if our lack of an association was due to our small preliminary sample size.</p>
      <p>The strength of an individual’s social connections (i.e., its network centrality) was negatively related to age. However, more socially connected individuals had a greater probability of elevated blood lead after accounting for age and site effects. Thus, we feel that data generated from Condor Watch will be valuable to help determine factors that can predict a condor’s lead poisoning risk, as well as understand condor social network behavior more generally.</p>

    summary: '''
      California condors are the largest North American terrestrial bird and one of the world’s rarest species. Condor populations collapsed to only 22 individuals in the 1980s before being captured, bred in captivity, and released again to reform wild populations. We are working to understand the threats to this species, and how to plan for its continued recovery from the brink of extinction.

      <p>California condors (<i>Gymnogyps californianus</i>) are one of the world’s most endangered bird species with a global population approaching only a few dozen birds in the early 1980s. Despite successful captive breeding and release efforts in recent years, condors remain heavily managed because they are frequently poisoned by lead from bullet fragments ingested in scavenged carcasses. Condor release sites offer uncontaminated carcasses to birds as a way to lure them back for medical care and regular management activities. Release sites are equipped with automatically triggered cameras that have captured photographs of condors in the past 10 years. The Condor Watch Project will analyze these photographs in order to understand how the personalities and social status of individual birds may predispose them to lead poisoning and to eventually gather critical real-time information on the health and status of these highly vulnerable birds.</p>

Vickie’s focus is adapting the academic tools of quantitative conservation ecology to solve the real world problems of conservation practitioners managing rare and endangered species. She has developed population models and evaluated management options for species ranging from island fox to northern woodland caribou to black-footed albatross. Vickie brings expertise in large-scale data analysis and quantitative population biology to Condor Watch. She will harness the power of a hefty existing database on the life and times of each condor to help understand what the social lives of condors reveal about their risk of contaminant exposure, their breeding success and survival, and ultimately their long-term population dynamics.
