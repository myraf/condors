      title: 'The California condors need your help!'
      content: '''
        The California condor is a critically endangered species and the population is suffering from the affects of lead poisoning.
        By tracking the location and social behavior of the creatures we can better detect early warning signs of the illness.

    whatDo:
      title: 'What can you do?'
      content: '''
        We need you to look at some photos of condors taken by our motion-activated cameras.
        By identifying the tag number of each condor and their behavior around the feeding carcass,
        we can judge if the bird's eating or social problems can reveal lead poisoning.
